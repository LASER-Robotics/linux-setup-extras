## Summary

This repo contains settings of Tiago's Linux work environment.

It could be summarized as follows:
* **ROS 2 - Humble Hawksbill**
* **tweaks** ubuntu plus settings manager
* **chrome** Google Chrome browser
* **sublime** Sublime text
* **zoom** Zoom meeting app
* **dolphin** File manager
* **My tools** terminal file manager
  * **tlp** battery/power manager
  * **nativefier** webapp creator
   * nodejs
  
To clone and install everything run following code. **BEWARE**, running this will **DELETE** your current .i3, tmux, vim, etc. dotfiles.

*PLASE: Install it AFTER installing linux-steup environment: https://github.com/LASER-Robotics/linux-setup*

```bash
cd /tmp
echo "cd ~/mygit
git clone https://github.com/LASER-Robotics/linux-setup-extras.git
cd linux-setup-extras
./install.sh" > run.sh && source run.sh
```
**Calling install.sh repeatedly** will not cause acumulation of code in your .bashrc, so feel free to update your configuration by rerunning it.

# Troubleshooting

It is possible and probable that after you update using ```git pull```, something might not work anymore.
This usually happens due to new programs, plugins, and dependencies that might not be satisfied anymore.
I suggest re-running **install.sh**, after each update.
